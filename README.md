# Portable C and C++ Development Kit for x64 Windows

w64devkit is a Dockerfile that builds from source a small, portable
development suite for creating C and C++ applications on and for x64
Windows. **It is the highest quality native toolchain for C, C++, and
Fortran currently available on Windows.**

Included tools:

* [Mingw-w64 GCC][w64] : compilers, linker, assembler
* [GDB][gdb] : debugger
* [GNU Make][make] : standard build tool
* [busybox-w32][bb] : standard unix utilities, including sh
* [Vim][vim] : powerful text editor
* [Universal Ctags][ctags] : source navigation
* [NASM][nasm] : x86 assembler

The compilers support pthreads, C++11 threads, and OpenMP. All included
libraries are static. Docker is not required to use the development kit.
It's merely a reliable, clean environment for building the kit itself.

## Build

First build the image, then run it to produce a distribution .zip file:

    docker build -t w64devkit .
    docker run --rm w64devkit >w64devkit.zip

This takes about half an hour on modern systems. You will need an
internet connection during the first couple minutes of the build.

## Usage

The final .zip file contains tools in a typical unix-like configuration.
Unzip the contents anywhere. Inside is an `activate.bat` that launches a
console window with the environment configured and ready to go. It is the
easiest way to enter the development environment, and requires no system
changes.

Alternatively, add the `bin/` directory to your path. For example, while
inside a console or batch script:

    set PATH=c:\path\to\w64devkit\bin;%PATH%

To start an interactive unix shell:

    busybox sh -l

## Best of class

What makes w64devkit the best? It is the *only* production-grade, native
toolchain for Windows which:

* Does not require installation. Run it anywhere as any user.

* Does not require internet access during installation. The installers for
  other toolchains are actually downloaders, and so must be online for at
  least part of their installation process.

* Supports C99 by default. The others have incomplete support or require
  esoteric configurations in order to enable it.

It's the only MinGW / Mingw-w64 distribution that produces binaries that
do not depend on extra runtime DLLs. You will never need to distribute a
DLL with your binary unless you explicitly choose to do so.

## Optimized for size

The language runtimes in w64devkit are optimized for size, so it produces
particularly small binaries when programs are also optimized for size
(`-Os`) during compilation. If your program only uses the `printf` family
of functions with MSVC-compatable directivies (i.e. limited to C89), and
you want even smaller binaries, you can avoid embdedding the Mingw-w64's
improved implementation by setting `__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO` to 0 before
including any headers.

    $ cc -Os -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=0 ...

## Fortran support

Only C and C++ are included by default, but w64devkit also has full
support for Fortran. To build a Fortran compiler, add `fortran` to the
`--enable-languages` lines in the Dockerfile.

## Notes

Since the development kit is intended to be flexible, light, and
portable — i.e. run from anywhere, in place, and no installation is
necessary — the binaries are all optimized for size, not speed.

Due to [an old GCC bug][bug], we must build a cross-compiler to
cross-compile GCC itself because, due to host contamination, GCC can
only be correctly and safely cross-compiled by a matching version.

I'd love to include Git, but unfortunately Git's build system doesn't
quite support cross-compilation, and it's hostile to installation-free
.zip distribution (lots of symlinks). A decent backup solution would be
[Quilt][quilt], but it's written in Perl.

What about sanitizer support? That would be fantastic, but unfortunately
libsanitizer [has not yet been ported from MSVC to Mingw-w64][san]
([also][san2]).

Since the build environment is so stable and predicable, it would be
great for the .zip to be reproducible, i.e. builds by different people
are bit-for-bit identical. There are multiple reasons why this is not
currently the case, the least of which are [timestamps in the .zip
file][zip].

## Licenses

When distributing binaries built using w64devkit, your .exe will include
parts of this distribution. For the GCC runtime, including OpenMP, you're
covered by the [GCC Runtime Library Exception][gpl] so you do not need to
do anything. However the Mingw-w64 runtime [has the usual software license
headaches][bs] and you may need to comply with various BSD-style licenses
depending on the functionality used by your program: [MinGW-w64 runtime
licensing][lic1] and [winpthreads license][lic2]. To make this easy,
w64devkit includes the concatenated set of all licenses in the file
`COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt`, which should be distributed with your
binaries.
